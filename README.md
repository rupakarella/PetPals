Java Coding Challenge

Project Overview: PetPals is a comprehensive software system designed to facilitate the adoption of pets, such as dogs and cats, from shelters or rescue organizations. The platform serves as a digital marketplace where potential adopters can browse and select pets, shelters can list available pets, and donors can contribute to support animal welfare.
